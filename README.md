# withinhost_fitnessInference

Here you will find code that is able to infer fitness effects of viral variants in the context of cellular coinfection. We implement two deterministic and stochastic frameworks to accomplish this task

Each main directory you see above contains two subdirectories. One contains code relevant to the production and analysis of the simulated datasets. The other contains code relevant to the analysis and inference applied to the Wilker H5N1 dataset.
